# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification
This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using deep learning models and run it on Streamlit application.

# **Models Trained**
1) CNN Model
2) VGG16
3) ResNet50
4) MobileNet
5) InceptionV3
6) EfficientNetB0

# **Steps Followed**
1) Data Pre-processing
2) Data Augmentation
3) Training the Models
4) Evaluating the Training,Validation and Testing Accuracy
5) Visualization and Classification Report
6) Best Model saved as .h5 file for deployement
7) Deployed -
   (i) Using Streamlit Application.
   (ii) Allows Users to upload a fish image
   (iii) Predict and displays fish class/category
   (iv) Predict the Confidence score
